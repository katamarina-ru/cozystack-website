Backups are everyone's responsibility and, too often, nobody's job. On a multi-tenant platform the problem is sharper: tenants want to protect their own databases and VMs, but they shouldn't be handed S3 credentials or asked to wire up storage. Cozystack closes that gap with **platform-managed backups** — a clear API where tenants declare **what** to protect and the platform takes care of **where** and **how**.

## The model in one minute

There are five objects, split cleanly between two audiences.

Tenant-facing:

- **BackupJob** — a one-off backup.
- **Plan** — scheduled (cron) backups.
- **Backup** — represents the artifact produced by a BackupJob.
- **RestoreJob** — restores a backup into a target application.

Admin-owned:

- **BackupClass** — binds an application Kind to a backup strategy and storage, and tunes desired parameters.

Tenants reference a `BackupClass` by name and never see S3 endpoints, credentials, paths, or underlying resources — those are accessible to cluster administrators only. The platform performs backups in a managed way and guarantees robustness and stability.

Cozystack ships a predefined class `cozy-default` and a storage bucket `cozy-backups` — no configuration needed to get started.

## For tenant users: back up and restore your apps

The `cozy-default` BackupClass is provisioned automatically and already covers Postgres, MariaDB, ClickHouse, Etcd, and KubeVirt VMs (`VMInstance`, `VMDisk`). You only need to select your application — no configuration or storage setup required.

We recommend starting with a one-shot `BackupJob` to verify correct operation before setting up a scheduled Plan.

```yaml
apiVersion: backups.cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: BackupJob
metadata:
  name: oneshot-mariadb
  namespace: tenant-user1
spec:
  applicationRef:
    apiGroup: apps.cozystack.io
    kind: MariaDB
    name: mariadbinstance
  backupClassName: cozy-default
```

Use `Plan` for recurring backups:

{{< figure src="6.png" alt="Plan list view showing active scheduled backup plans and their last run status" width="720" >}}

```yaml
apiVersion: backups.cozystack.io/v1alpha1
kind: Plan
metadata:
  name: maria-nightly-backups
  namespace: tenant-user1
spec:
  applicationRef:
    apiGroup: apps.cozystack.io
    kind: MariaDB
    name: mariadbinstance
  backupClassName: cozy-default
  schedule:
    type: cron
    cron: "0 2 * * *"  # at 02:00
```

Once a BackupJob reaches `phase: Succeeded`, you can restore from it:

Restoring comes in two flavors. A `RestoreJob` either replays into the same application (**in-place** — fast rollback, but destructive) or into a freshly provisioned copy of the same Kind (**to-copy** — safe for DR drills and validation). You choose by whether you set `targetApplicationRef`.

## For cluster admins: defaults, tuning, and opt-ins

For most platforms, `cozy-default` ships ready and your tenants can back up immediately without any setup.

Reach for a custom `BackupClass` when you need to:

- **tune retention** for a specific application or tenant;
- **enable a new Kind** not bound by default;
- **use a dedicated bucket** — split storage for simplified maintenance.

## Going further: custom strategies

The backups API is extensible. If a driver you need doesn't exist yet, you have two routes:

- **No code:** the generic Job-based strategy. Reuse a plain Kubernetes Job as the backup mechanism — useful for bespoke or self-managed workloads. See the [NATS example](https://github.com/cozystack/cozystack/blob/main/examples/backups/nats/01-create-strategy.sh).
- **A custom strategy controller** built against the backups API and embedded in Cozystack, for first-class lifecycle handling.
